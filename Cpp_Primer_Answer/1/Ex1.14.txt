A while loop will always evaluate the condition first.

A do/while loop will always execute the code in the do{} block first and then evaluate the condition.

A for loop allows you to initiate a counter variable, a check condition, and a way to increment your counter all in one line.

The main difference between the for's and the while's is a matter of pragmatics: we usually use for when there is a known number of iterations, and use while constructs when the number of iterations in not known in advance. 
The while vs do ... while issue is also of pragmatics, the second executes the instructions once at start, and afterwards it behaves just like the simple while.
