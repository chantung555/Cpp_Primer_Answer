Definition:
Pointer: points to any other types.
Reference: another name of an object.

Difference:
1. Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object. There is no way to rebind a reference to a different object. A pointer can be assigned and copied.
2. A reference must be initialized. a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined.
