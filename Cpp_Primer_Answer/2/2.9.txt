(a)
error: expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction

Reason: The int variable isn't initialised, so its value is uncertain.

int input_value{0};
std::cin >> input_value;

(b)
warning: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 3.14 to 3 [-Wliteral-conversion]

The variable i is of type integral, when it is assigned with a value of type double, the value will lose its precision.

double i = {3.14}

(c)
error: use of undeclared identifier 'wage'

The variable wage isn't declared before.

double wage;
double salary = wage = 9999.999;

(d)
warning: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 3.14 to 3 [-Wliteral-conversion]

The variable i is of type integral, when it is assigned with a value of type double, the value will lose its precision.

double i = 3.14;
